## Built With

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/)
* [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/)

## Local Installation

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [A MySQL database](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [yukon](https://github.com/wizguin/yukon)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.

```console
git clone https://github.com/wizguin/yukon-server
```

2. Install node dependencies.

```console
npm install
```

3. Copy "config_example.json" to a new file called "config.json".

4. Generate a new crypto secret.

```console
npm run secret-gen
```

5. Import yukon.sql into your MySQL database.

6. Update MySQL database credentials.

```json
"database": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "user": "user",
    "password": "password",
    "database": "yukon",
    "dialect": "mysql",
    "debug": false
},
```

### Usage

* Running the dev server.

```console
npm run dev
```

* Building the server for production.

```console
npm run build
```

* Running the server in production mode. This will start all worlds listed in config.json.

```console
npm run start
```

* Stopping production servers.

```console
npm run stop
```

* Restarting production servers.

```console
npm run restart
```

* Listing production servers.

```console
npm run list
```

* Display live logs for production servers

```console
npm run logs
```

* PM2 monitor for production servers.

```console
npm run monit
```

* Generate a new crypto secret.

```console
npm run secret-gen
```

### Account creation

The easiest way to create accounts locally would be to simply enter them manually. Make sure to use a bcrypt hashed password, a tool such as [this](https://www.browserling.com/tools/bcrypt) can be used to generate one.

```console
$2a$10$nAxC5GXU0i/dacalTX.iZuRrtpmwmZ9ZzL.U3Zroh0jeSXiswFsne
```

## Production Usage

The following is required when running the project in production.

* The project must first be built using the build command.

```console
npm run build
```

* HTTPS can be configured as follows. Make sure your web server is also configured to use HTTPS.

```console
"socketio": {
    "https": true,
    "ssl": {
        "cert": "/path/to/cert.crt",
        "ca": "/path/to/ca.ca-bundle",
        "key": "/path/to/key.key"
    }
},
```

* The CORS origin must be set. This will likely just be your domain name, e.g "example.com".

```console
"cors": {
    "origin": "example.com"
},
```

* Run the server in production mode.

```console
npm run start
```
